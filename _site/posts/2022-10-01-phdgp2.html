<p>The Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project 2.0 was a workshop where my
colleagues and I trained 150 Public Health professionals from diverse
backgrounds (city and state health departments, advocacy organizations, policy
think-tanks, academia, non-profits, etc.) on how to use geo-referenced data for
analyses that promote health equity.</p>

<p>I am so proud of what we were able to accomplish in this training in terms of
recruiting participants from such diverse backgrounds, selecting them from out
of over 500 applicants, and designing workshops for them that met them where
they were no matter their skill level or area of focus.</p>

<p>The workshops emphasized myriad topics including best practices for disease
mapping, spatial modeling of disease rates, data visualization, and how to
structure health communication in a way that actively combats the
stigmatization of marginalized groups.</p>

<p>One of the ways that we were able to meet participants needs no matter their
background was through the deliberate structuring of distinct areas of emphasis
throughout the course.  The three areas of emphasis that we identified that individuals
could choose to focus on depending on their personal experience and background were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interpretation:  How do we interpret the measures and analytic results we
construct? To whom do they apply?  How can we describe the motivation and
need for the methods we employ?</li>
  <li>Data Wrangling &amp; Coding: How do we use programming code to construct our
measures and models of interest?  How do we deal with idiosyncracies in the
data like numerator/denominator mismatch?</li>
  <li>Communication: What are the best approaches for communicating with
different kinds of stakeholders? How do we leverage color most
appropriately in data visualization while being inclusive to those with
color-blindness? How do we craft our messages to avoid stigmatizing places
and populations?</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these three tracks are reflected in the posters that we designed to
accompany our workshop and training manual.</p>
