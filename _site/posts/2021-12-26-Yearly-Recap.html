<p>I couldn’t really talk about 2021 without mentioning that I got married in June 2021!</p>

<h2 id="i-got-married">I got married!</h2>

<p>Our photographer, <a href="https://www.ohnokohnophotos.com/">Tamara</a>, did a great job taking photos of our ceremony.  Here are some of my favorites.</p>

<h2 id="published-papers-and-working-papers">Published papers and working papers</h2>

<p>I had a number of published papers and working papers.  Some of 
the work I’m the most proud of include work in a preprint we shared on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3933453"><em>The Evolving Roles of US Political Partisanship and Social Vulnerability in the COVID-19 Pandemic from February 2020 - February 2021</em></a>.</p>

<p>All of my articles are listed on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=_9VD8mkAAAAJ">my Google Scholar page</a>, but I particularly appreciated the emphasis that our <em>Evolving Roles</em> article
had on considering competing models.  Testing competing model implementations is one of the 
10 “not so simple” rules for credible practice of modeling and simulation identified
by the Committee on Credible Practice of Modeling and Simulation in Healthcare 
seeded from a U.S. interagency initiative in <a href="https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-020-02540-4">this article</a>.</p>

<h2 id="photography">Photography</h2>

<p>I’ve been taking photography a lot more seriously this year
and I’m proud of the results.  I think I’ve taken some 
stunning shots and I enjoy looking at them, so I hope others
do too.</p>

<p>Of course I would be remiss if I didn’t mention my new puppy Hodu.</p>

<p>He is quite the character.</p>

<h2 id="ideas-for-2022">Ideas for 2022</h2>

<p>I hope that in 2022 we all strive to create a better world.  I want to see those who 
are intent to build a more equitable and sustainable world empowered to do so.  I want
to see humanity build and implement a better future.  I would ask if that’s too much 
to ask for, but I don’t think it is.</p>

<!--
I have some ideas, mostly phrased as questions, that I'll be ruminating on as we head into 2022 

1. Modeling knowledge and uncertainty;
2. How to model space, time, and social dimensions?
3. How does one create sustainable software?
4. How does one teach to the benefit of everyone?
5. What is accountability, when do we need it, and how do we create it?
6. What does practicing health as a virtue mean?
7. What kind of future do we want, and how can we see it realized?
