Tuesday September 3rd, the first day of our semester, I needed to cover
teaching for our professor teaching BST/BIOSTATS 230 Probability I, so as part of that
I got to lecture on the history of probability as an academic field, which I thoroughly
enjoyed. 

I needed to stick roughly to the gist of his pre-existing slides, but I wanted to give some 
of my own emphasis to what I presented, so I wrote some lecture notes to go along with 
the slides.
