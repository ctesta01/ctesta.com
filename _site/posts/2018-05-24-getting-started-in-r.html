<h3 id="beginner-resources">Beginner Resources</h3>

<p>Before diving into the R programming language, I would highly recommend
installing the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> development environment.
It makes a lot of interactions with the R programming language and peripheral
programming related tasks (version controlling, connecting to databases, code-formatting, etc.) much easier.</p>

<p>If you’re a beginner and you want to get started with R as fast as possible, 
I recommend the following guides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://swirlstats.com/">Swirl : Learn R, in R</a> - Swirl allows newcomers to
start interacting with the R programming language through guided tutorials 
primarily aimed at beginners.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/r/">Learn X in Y Minutes : R</a> - Learn X
in Y Minutes walks readers through an example script which demonstrates
many of the important R language features without getting too bogged down
on any specific topic. This is a great quick reference for the syntax of R.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/r_language_for_programmers/">R Language for Programmers</a> - If you have any experience programming but are new to R, or would simply like a quick refresher on the basic language features of R, this is a good reference.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.cookbook-r.com/">Cookbook for R</a> - This website (and its corresponding book) provide examples and tutorials on many of the most common tasks that programmers are accomplishing with R.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, I want to encourage people to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">help.start()</code> feature in R.
Open the R console, type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">help.start()</code>, and hit enter. A window will open
which allows you to view the R manuals, check out packages’ documentation, 
and search for keywords on R-specific sites and resources.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that you can always use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?command</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">help()</code> to look up help
without leaving your R or RStudio session.</p>

<h3 id="more-technical-resources">More Technical Resources</h3>

<p>Once you have an understanding of the basics in R, at some point you 
will likely want to understand how to write <em>better</em> code instead of 
code that barely meets your needs. The following resources 
will help you understand the design and motivations behind the R programming
language and will, in turn, will help you become a better R programmer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf">An Introduction to R</a> - This introduction to R is quite comprehensive and technical. I should 
point out that while other guides may discuss packages outside the base R language, this introduction focuses entirely on the base R language. Many people will recommend that it is important to understand the base R language, and then to quickly move onto using the nearly self-contained ecosystems 
implemented in packages like the tidyverse,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://arrgh.tim-smith.us/">aRrgh, a newcomer’s (angry) guide to R</a> -
aRrgh takes the stance that as R is a programming language predominantly
developed by statisticians and not programmers, it has some very quirky and
at times outright offensive features. Despite this, R comes with tools and
ideas that make it uniquely suitable for statistical data analysis and
after learning its quirks many people find R to be an indespensible tool
they frequently reach for. aRrgh is a guide on those quirks and “gotchas.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf">The R
Inferno</a> - “If you are
using R and you think you’re in hell, this is a map for you.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/">R-Bloggers : Tutorials for Learning

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/index.html">Efficient R Programming</a> - This book takes a dive into the topic of writing R code which is efficient while keeping the prerequisite knowledge of the language to a minimum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/intro.html">R Packages</a> - R Packages are an 
integral part of the R ecosystem, and it is considered good practice to
format your work as a package where possible due to the many added perks
gained from R’s package development tools.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/">Advanced R</a> - Advanced R takes a closer look at
the technical features of the R programming language to help users improve
their R programming skills.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">The R Manuals</a> - The R Manuals from CRAN are
for those who want to take a deep dive into the fundamentals of the R
programming language. In particular, I recommend checking out The R Language
Definition and R Internals if you really want to understand how R works.</p>
