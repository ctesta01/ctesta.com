<p>This last Thursday (May 9th, 2024), Bhramar Mukherjee received the 
annual Marvin Zelen Award from the Harvard Biostatistics Department.</p>

<p>Sometimes a talk leaves you with enough food for thought that you simply have to
write down the highlights somewhere you know you can come back to them, and Dr. 
Mukherjee’s certainly fits the bill.</p>

<p>Her talk was on <em>Data Equity in Health Research</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the nascency of the field:</p>

<p>She asks the question: when was the first textbook in statistics written,
soliciting guesses from the audience. The answer is in  Agresti, A. (2023). A
historical overview of textbook presentations of statistical science. Scand J
Statist, 50(4), 1641–1666. https://doi.org/10.1111/sjos.12641.</p>

<hr />

<p>On Marvin Zelen and his legacy:</p>

<p>“What remains after papers and awards fade away are people and culture.”</p>

<p>She argues that though critical work was done by Marvin Zelen, the 
truly impactful legacy in is effect on the department — making it a welcoming
place, intellectually curious, and emphasizing “statistical science” — that
the field cannot be just methods, but must be grounded in science too.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the racial/ethnic makeup of biobank/genetics study participants:</p>

<p>She showed this figure from Fatumo, S., Chikowore, T., Choudhury, A. et al. A roadmap to increase diversity in genomic studies. Nat Med 28, 243–250 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01672-4</p>
