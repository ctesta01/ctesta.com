## About Me {style="margin-top: -15px;"}

Hello! I am a first year PhD student in the Department of Biostatistics at the 
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. My research interest areas
include causal inference, infectious diseases, and spatial statistics.

Recently I worked (2020-2023) as a statistical data analyst with Nancy Krieger and
Jarvis Chen in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at the Harvard
T.H. Chan School of Public Health on 
projects including: 

- The Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project 2.0
- Two NIH R01 grant funded projects: 
  - DNA methylation & adversity: pathways from exposures to health inequities
  - Advancing novel methods to measure and analyze multiple types of discrimination for population health research
- A COVID-19 Paper Series 
:::

Prior, I worked (2017-2020) in the Department of Global Health and 
Population at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health with Joshua Soloman (now
at Stanford) and Nicolas Menzies in the Prevention Policy Modeling Lab as a data
analyst and programmer on several CDC grant funded projects. 

Those projects included: 

  - A web-app to allow users to interact with a Bayesian simulation model of 
  tuberculosis in the US 50 states and DC under user-configurable scenarios. 
  - Papers on gonorrhea, syphilis, and tuberculosis transmission in US contexts
  and implications for strategies for prevention.

I received my Bachelors of Science in Mathematics from Tufts University in 2017.
