Now that our paper is out in the Lancet Regional Health Americas, I wanted to write up a blog post talking about it.

One of the main contributions this paper makes is that it considers above and beyond the voter lean of 
the public what the impact of political ideology of US House and Senate representatives may have been 
during the first year in which vaccines were widely available for adults (April 2021–March 2022). 

Part of what made this work possible was having the data available on Congressional representative's political 
ideology/leaning available from Voteview.com which applies a principle components analysis type approach
to Congressional representatives' votes on individual bills.  This allowed us to incorporate information not just 
on whether representatives were Republican or Democratic, but the degree to which they leaned Republican or 
Democratic.

We included a quite substantial list of county level covariates, described
fully in the captions to our figures in the article. Click on the below images

Figure 2 depicted the bivariate relationships between COVID-19 mortality, ICU capacity, and several of our most important 
covariates stratified by state trifecta status (i.e., whether the House, Senate, and Governorship were all controlled by the same party or divided). 

<a href="/assets/img/2022-11-01/figure2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">![Figure 2: trends in age standardized COVID-19 mortality and ICU occupancy related to covariates and stratified by trifecta status](/img/2022-11-01/figure2.jpg)</a>

Figures 3 and 4 showed how various political ideology metrics were associated
with our outcomes of interest either in univariate relationships (model 1),
after adjusting for demographic and social metrics (like median age, log
population density, percent below poverty, the Index of Concentration at the
Extremes for Racialized Economic Segregation, and racial/ethnic composition)
(model 2), after additionally adjusting for all of the other political metrics
(model 3), after further adjusting for vaccination (model 4), and after 
adjusting for risk factors like the percent with obesity and diagnosed with
diabetes (model 5).  Essentially this follows the logic of starting out with an
un-adjusted analysis that compares the outcomes (age standardized COVID-19
mortality and ICU occupancy) with each of the political metrics one-at-a-time
in model 1 and then adds on additional variables sequentially going from model
2 to 5 to illustrate how much of the effect associated with political ideology
may be explained by associations with other measured factors.


One of the things that I think is so great about this paper is that it provides
an almost perfect followup to some of our previous work, [*The Evolving Roles
of US Political Partisanship and Social Vulnerability in the COVID-19 Pandemic
from February 2020 - February
2021*](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3933453) both in
terms of the subject-matter of focus and the time-periods being studied.  I
think it's particularly nice that we were able to study the February
2020-February 2021 time-period as a timeframe during which trends in the
pandemic were largely driven by factors unrelated to vaccination, and to follow
that up with a separate paper focused on March 2021-April 2022 when vaccines
were a much larger part of the picture.

In that paper we put much more emphasis on the role of voter lean (as in the
political lean of the population residing within each county) rather than the
political lean of representatives.  For example, figure 3 from that paper drove
home the point that the relationship between voter lean and COVID-19 mortality
was changing as the pandemic progressed.

This blog post isn't about that paper, but I think the two papers are worth reading together.

One final word on this is that I'd just like to say it's been extremely
gratifying seeing our work pay off.  At one point the [press release](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/political-ideology-of-u-s-elected-officials-linked-with-covid-19-health-outcomes/)
written about our article was on the cover of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of
Public Health website, and our article appears at the top of the list in the
Most Read articles of the Lancet Regional Health Americas.  Publicity isn't everything, 
but it's nice to see that our article is reaching a wide audience and hopefully 
advancing thought on the political determinants of public health.
