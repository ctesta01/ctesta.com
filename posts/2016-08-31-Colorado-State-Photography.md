I went to Colorado in the summer of 2016 and found some heart-moving and 
serene photography opportunities. I spent time in Denver, Boulder, and, of course, the 
Rocky Mountain National Park. I struggle to imagine a more picturesque
photography experience than that with the brazen elk 
right next to the road and the incredible and towering mountain ranges spanning
the park. The sense of peace that I could derive from 
spending time in the park is a memory that will always
motivate my desire to spend more time in nature. 
I truly enjoyed my time in Colorado, and I recommend that anybody 
with an interest in the outdoors find the time to enjoy
the beautiful scenery there.
