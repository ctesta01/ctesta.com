The Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project 2.0 was a workshop where my
colleagues and I trained 150 Public Health professionals from diverse
backgrounds (city and state health departments, advocacy organizations, policy
think-tanks, academia, non-profits, etc.) on how to use geo-referenced data for
analyses that promote health equity. 


I am so proud of what we were able to accomplish in this training in terms of
recruiting participants from such diverse backgrounds, selecting them from out
of over 500 applicants, and designing workshops for them that met them where
they were no matter their skill level or area of focus.

The workshops emphasized myriad topics including best practices for disease
mapping, spatial modeling of disease rates, data visualization, and how to
structure health communication in a way that actively combats the
stigmatization of marginalized groups.

One of the ways that we were able to meet participants needs no matter their
background was through the deliberate structuring of distinct areas of emphasis
throughout the course.  The three areas of emphasis that we identified that individuals
could choose to focus on depending on their personal experience and background were: 

  * Interpretation:  How do we interpret the measures and analytic results we
    construct? To whom do they apply?  How can we describe the motivation and
    need for the methods we employ?
  * Data Wrangling & Coding: How do we use programming code to construct our
    measures and models of interest?  How do we deal with idiosyncracies in the
    data like numerator/denominator mismatch? 
  * Communication: What are the best approaches for communicating with
    different kinds of stakeholders? How do we leverage color most
    appropriately in data visualization while being inclusive to those with
    color-blindness? How do we craft our messages to avoid stigmatizing places
    and populations? 

Each of these three tracks are reflected in the posters that we designed to
accompany our workshop and training manual.

Speaking of our training manual, all of our workshop materials are fully free and open-access online 
contained in our training manual available at <https://phdgp.github.io/PHDGP2.0/index.html>.

The training manual was created in R using the [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) package by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/en/).

Lastly, I just want to share that the videos from our trainings are available online.
